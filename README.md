## Interesting Code

This project is inspired by Keith Schwarz's [The Archive of Interesting Code](http://www.keithschwarz.com/interesting/),
I hope both to learn the algorithms and to practice various programming languages
(since I will use different languages to implement those algorithms and data structures).

| Name | Language | Description |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
|[Shunting-Yard Algorithm](./code/ShuntingYard.py) | Python | An implementation of Dijkstra's shunting-yard algorithm for converting infix expression to postfix expression|
|[Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm](./code/kmp.go) | Go | An implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for fast string matching.|
|[Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm](./code/kmp-rust) | Rust | An implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm in Algorithms 4th.|
|[A WebAssembly Interpreter](./code/rocket) | Python | Source code of 'A Talk Near the Future of Python' by David Beazley.|
|[An Infix Calculator](./code/calc.py) | Python | An implementation of the Infix Calculator in book *The AWS Programming Language*.|
