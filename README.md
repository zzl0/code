## Interesting Code

This project is inspired by Keith Schwarz's [The Archive of Interesting Code](http://www.keithschwarz.com/interesting/),
I hope both to learn the algorithms and to practice various programming languages
(since I will use different languages to implement those algorithms and data structures).
